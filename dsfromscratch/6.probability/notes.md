# Chapter 6
- Need to review more on probability
- [Introduction to Probability by Charles M. Grinstead and J. Laurie Snell](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~prob/prob/prob.pdf)

## PDF - Probability Density Function
- Used for contineous variables
- Descrete variable probability
    - 6 sided dice, probability of getting any number is 1/6. No such thing as getting 2.5, can only be 2 or 3.
    - cumulative probability is the sum of probabilities for anything less than a given value.

## CDF Cumulative Density Function
- Always equals 1
- All probabilites added up

## The Normal Distribution
- Mean (mu)
- Standard deviation (sigma)
