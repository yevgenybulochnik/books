# Chapter 4
## Linear Algebra
- Underpins a large number of data science concepts and techniques

### Vectors
- Vectors are objects that can be added together to form new vectors and that
  can be multiplied by scalars (ie, numbers), also to form new vectors.
- Vectors of data can be "stacked" next to each other to form dimensions of a
  data set
    - Class with 4 exams `[exam1, exam2, exam3, exam4]` has 4 dimensions and 4
      vectors of data
