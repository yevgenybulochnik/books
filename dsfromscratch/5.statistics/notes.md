## Statistics
- Median custom function has two private methods. These methods while they can
  be imported and used like any other function are considered privte because
  they are not intended to be used directly. They are implementation details of
  the actual median function. Only the median function should be imported

## Central Tendancies
- Mean, median and mode

## Dispersion
- How spread out is your data
- Range, mean, variance, standard deviation, interquartile range

## Correlation
- Covariance, is the paired analogue of variance. Variance measures how a single
  variable deviates from its mean, covariance measures how two variables vary in
  tandem from their means
  - large positive value means x tends to be large when y is large
  - large negative value means x tends to be small when y is large
  - zero means no relationship exists

- Correlation is used more frequently than covariance as it is easier to
  understand
  - Simply a value from -1 to 1
  - Vulnerable to outliers
